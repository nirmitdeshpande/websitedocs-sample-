I recorded a talk for the virtual ECS meeting, but I didn’t end up submitting it due to a registration fee snafu. So, I uploaded it to YouTube in case anyone is interested.

The paper associated with this talk is [here](https://doi.org/10.1149/1945-7111/ab8ce4).

As an aside, I wonder how feasible an alternate “bottom-up” model for conferences would be, where presenters simply upload their recorded talks to YouTube and submit an abstract to a simple website.
