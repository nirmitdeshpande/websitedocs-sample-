Last year, [I published a paper in *Nature*](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-020-1994-5). However, when I went to check out the fruits of my labor on the day it was published, I could not access the paper. Tesla does not pay for any journal subscriptions, and thus I was unable to read the final version of a paper I had worked on for nearly 3 years.

While somewhat amusing (and easily resolved by asking for a copy from my academic coauthors), I found this scenario ridiculous. This moment was my wake-up call in support of open access.

The benefits of open access are [well documented](https://plos.org/open-science/why-open-access/) and don’t need repeating here. The argument that perhaps resonates most strongly with me is inclusion: so many people are locked out of science that should be able to learn and contribute, including industrial scientists, high school teachers and students, and scientists from developing countries. I think it’s hard to argue that the scientific enterprise supports diversity, equity, and inclusion when such a key output is only accessible to people already in the system. More positively, in an era of [limited scientific literacy](https://www.pewresearch.org/science/2019/03/28/what-americans-know-about-science/), what an opportunity to bring more people into the fold!

As an industrial scientist, my most productive publishing years are likely behind me. But as much as I can help it, I resolve to publish my work in open access journals. Because I don’t have any research grants, I also refuse to pay more than $300 for open access fees (the [*Journal of Open Source Software*](https://joss.theoj.org) estimated their hosting costs were [$2.71/paper](https://blog.joss.theoj.org/2019/06/cost-models-for-running-an-online-open-journal), or $100 including editor compensation). From my review, that leaves only three reputable journals even remotely related to my field (contact me if I missed any!):
- [*Journal of the Electrochemical Society*](https://www.electrochem.org/publications/oa) (JES): $256 for ECS members (membership is [~$100/year](https://www.electrochem.org/individual-membership))
- [*Chemical Science*](https://www.rsc.org/journals-books-databases/open-access/): $0
- [*Journal of Open Source Software*](https://joss.theoj.org/about#costs) (JOSS): $0 

Overall, I love JES (and their ["Free the Science" initiative](https://freethescience.org)) and will likely keep publishing most of my work there for the foreseeable future.
