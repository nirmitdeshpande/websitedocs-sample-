I recently coauthored a paper entitled
["Predicting the impact of formation protocols on battery lifetime immediately after manufacturing"](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.joule.2021.09.015), led by Andrew Weng at the University of Michigan.
This paper explores prediction and optimization of formation protocols--
namely, Andrew identified a readily-measurable, physically-meaningful
formation signal that can predict cycle life.
I'm excited to see more work in this area---formation is ripe with opportunity!

See the [press release](https://news.umich.edu/resistance-is-not-futile-predicting-how-changes-in-production-materials-impact-ev-battery-life/) for a high-level summary.
