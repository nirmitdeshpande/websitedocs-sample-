I contributed to a recently-published paper lead by [Philipp Dechant](https://www.isea.rwth-aachen.de/cms/ISEA/Die-Organisationseinheit/Team/Leitungsebene-Abteilungsleitung-Prof-/~pkpq/Philipp-Dechent/lidx/1/) at RWTH Aachen University. The title of the paper is ["ENPOLITE: Comparing Lithium-Ion Cells across Energy, Power, Lifetime, and Temperature"](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acsenergylett.1c00743), where "ENPOLITE" is short for “energy power lifetime temperature”. The goal of this work is to enable cell comparisons across a variety of performance dimensions, a challenging yet important task.
